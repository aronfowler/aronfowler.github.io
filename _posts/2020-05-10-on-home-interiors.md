I am not a homeowner. On the issue of home interiors, I do not have the means to put theory into practice. I regard it responsible, however, to have contingencies in place should I be called to make arrangements regarding fixtures and fittings. Considerations herein are, therefore, preparatory and recorded only to provide a guiding document.  

* Tastes may be considered relative. In most cases, it is baseless to posit one taste as intrinsically superior to another. But a liking for clear glass tables demonstrates obvious psychological shortcomings - even the most liberal and post-modern thinkers find this to be a fact on firm ground. Glass has no business in a horizontal position. The only other instance is the car sunroof, but car sunroofs are now insignificant in number and tolerated only out of nostalgia. Since clear glass tables have no such nostalgic quality, and since they are hideous, they should not be a prominent feature in the home. More precisely, they should be excluded altogether. 

What is more, regardless of its real strength, glass gives the impression of fragility, causing one to act tentatively in oneâ€™s own home.  Full confidence can be placed only in a solid wooden table. Only with a wooden table, therefore, can a person loosen and feel at ease. 

Ownership of a clear glass table cannot be defended with the claim that despite its repulsive appearance and associations of fragility, it is in fact a flat, sturdy surface which serves as good as any other in practical terms. The defence falls short because functionality is necessary but not sufficient. It is the central and most fundamental tenet of design that products must have both form _and_ function.
