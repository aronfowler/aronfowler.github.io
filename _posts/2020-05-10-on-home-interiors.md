I am not a homeowner. On the issue of home interiors, I do not have the means to put theory into practice. I regard it responsible, however, to have contingencies in place should I be called to make arrangements regarding fixtures and fittings. Considerations herein are, therefore, preparatory and recorded only to provide a guiding document.

* Tastes may be considered relative. In most cases, it is baseless to posit one taste as intrinsically superior to another. But a liking for clear glass tables demonstrates obvious psychological shortcomings - even the most liberal and post-modern thinkers find this to be a fact on firm ground. Glass has no business in a horizontal position. The only other instance is the car sunroof, but car sunroofs are now insignificant in number and tolerated only out of nostalgia. Since clear glass tables have no such nostalgic quality, and since they are hideous, they should not be a prominent feature in the home. More precisely, they should be excluded altogether. 

  What is more, regardless of its real strength, glass gives the impression of fragility, causing one to act tentatively in one’s own home.  Full confidence can be placed only in a solid wooden table. Only with a wooden table, therefore, can a person loosen and feel at ease. 

  Ownership of a clear glass table cannot be defended with the claim that despite its repulsive appearance and associations of fragility, it is in fact a flat, sturdy surface which serves as good as any other in practical terms. The defence falls short because functionality is necessary but not sufficient. It is the central and most fundamental tenet of design that products must have both form _and_ function.

* Net curtains consist of a loose weave that provides daytime privacy whilst retaining maximum outward visibility; they are, therefore, of merit in their own right. But net curtains are now rare and so can also be installed in the name of conservation. In so doing, in reviving and sustaining a dying entity, the homeowner exercises a power over life and death itself, and thereby secures a reassuring sense of self-importance. 

  Therefore, if a homeowner feels unsettled or discovers a certain emptiness to their life - that the things they do, in the end, do not really matter or contribute to anything of wider significance-, net curtains should be installed. If the homeowner has no such feelings, net curtains are advisable as a preventative measure.

* Paintings in contemporary art museums, divide visitors broadly into two categories: those who pretend the work on display is somehow comprehensible; and those who admit openly that the work on display is, in reality, incomprehensible. Paintings in the home, by contrast, do not divide people along the same lines because they remain a background feature that is not called forward for particular inspection, and so their meaning never comes into question. 

  A painting of unpretentious composition will mitigate the brutality of a bare wall, particularly if the wall is painted a neutral colour. But, in the first instance, it would be an error to have walls painted a neutral colour; an appropriate wallpaper should be selected for more comforting results. Bathrooms walls may be tiled if affordable at the time.

* To live without windowsills is extremely traumatic. Windowsills are, therefore, essential.

* The ‘wood flooring versus fitted carpet’ debate continues in all quarters, but there is a third solution: an amenable rug on a wooden floor. 

  Partisans of fitted carpet contend that it is soft underfoot and provides comfort and warmth. They acknowledge a debt to underlay which underprops these qualities and ultimately determines the carpet’s longevity. The wood flooring camp only have one retort, though it is unanswerable. They highlight, correctly, that fitted carpets fall short on hygiene.  

  Rugs boast similar benefits to those of carpet but can be washed more thoroughly and with less difficulty. Outside of northern Europe, if the climate is appropriate, tiles can substitute wood.

* Visitors to the United Kingdom often complain of a plumbing set-up whereby hot and cold taps are separate and distinct, although this occurs much less in modern homes. They find the choice between scolding and freezing unreasonable when these extremes could be combined in one tap to produce water of a more agreeable temperature. These visitors make a good case but, ultimately, must be ignored.

  Two taps above one sink serve as a healthy reminder that any living arrangement is a matter of give and take, and it is through give and take that balance and harmony in the home is truly achieved. In light of this, Feng Shui need not be practiced (see below).

* The practice of Feng Shui need not be entertained with any seriousness owing to its logical incoherence and certain structural contradictions. 

  For example, water should be present and visible in order that all elements are in balance. At the same time, to prevent the loss of positive energies, toilet lids must be closed when not in use. If the toilet lid is closed, however, the water within the toilet, the only body of water in the bathroom, is no longer visible and the elements become unbalanced. There again, if the toilet lid is not closed, the water is visible but to the loss of positive energies.
