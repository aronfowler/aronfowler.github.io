When Ed Said had the decisive post-colonial word on power and ethnocentric representations (Orientalism), Western anthropologists on the rebound increasingly thought it best to leave the exotic _elsewhere_ alone. They turned their ethnographical examinations closer to home and studied people who looked like them. Aspiring researchers who had not had the means to intrude on native Amazonians or Saharan nomads discovered they were always already _in the field_ - in the supermarket, in the hairdressers, at work - only they had not taken care to make observations. 

Thereafter, there developed amongst some an almost palpable penchant for prosaic practices. The Far East was still far away but now far from their concern. They devised a new methodology which was only a variant of the old one, and began to integrate themselves as admin assistants in various HR departments across the North of England. Their aim was to access and interpret a plentiful cultural text that lived and breathed: the staffroom phenomenon of Dawn and Naheed. 

At a certain moment, through careful stewardship of the employee appraisal system, and having updated leave and absence policy documents as per manager instructions, they had earned their right to be there. Then, safely _in situ_, they stirred their coffees, sat tactfully amongst the subjects of their study and made the necessary arrangements for their eyes and ears to remain open. At a certain moment, through careful stewardship of the employee appraisal system, and having updated leave and absence policy documents as per manager instructions, they had earned their right to be there. Then, safely _in situ_, they stirred their coffees, sat tactfully amongst the subjects of their study and made the necessary arrangements for their eyes and ears to remain open. 

A preliminary survey of the staffroom’s spatial composition proved worthwhile when they noticed the sink was plumbed in and guaranteed to go nowhere. A tower of Avon brochures was under construction and scheduled to hit the ceiling soon. It was going nowhere either. But the tower was not firmly fixed in place; it did not have deep tubular roots and it was not stubbornly entrenched in a kitchen style work surface. 

Desperate for a theory, the anthropologists said that Dawn and Naheed entrusted the sink, therefore, to be their invariable geometrical reference point. (Semi-clean mugs were cached on the shelf _above_. Toaster, microwave and kettle lined up _adjacent_. Abrasive blue carpet tiles extended outwards from _beneath_ towards a quite orthodox seating area three metres _in front_.) If the two ladies perceived objects to have a stable location at break and lunch time, they owed it all to the sink, they said.

The astute anthropologists began to detect habits and patterns of behaviour. Every break time alike, Dawn and Naheed would occupy the seating area as if it was made specifically for sitting down. The seating area was an unflinching coffee table encircled by low-lying steel frame chairs, block padded and upholstered beetroot. In the Middle Ages, it became possible to build chimneys inside the house and familial congregations formed around the hearth. In a similar fashion, they reasoned that when seating areas were installed into staffrooms, common employees gathered around a biscuit tin – and in the case of Dawn and Naheed, the biscuit tin was generous.  

In every society, the body has been a site of attention, subject to obligations, constraints and prohibitions. Hence, the anthropologists were quick to record that Dawn and Naheed claimed to follow a Slimming World regime. But the biscuit tin testified to the contrary; the women had only a vague concern for losing weight. 

Between custard cream and Jammy Dodger, Dawn turned to Naheed, 

“We off to Fat Club this Saturday?”

“Well, I ought to. I’ve been terrible this week, me.” responded Naheed. 

“I know. Our Paul brought cheesecake home from work. And we had chips. I suppose we shouldn’t be eating these biccies, really.”

But underneath it all, the surplus calories seemed to come with a certain surplus enjoyment. Slimming World served to impose limits that were safe to breach, there was a thrill of transgression, and scones were more delicious when they were not permitted. Diogenes of Sinope said that hunger was the best sauce, but Slimming World offered a better one: the pretence of prohibition.  

Naheed showed Dawn a picture of her garden. Dawn asked Naheed if she wanted a cuppa soup. Naheed declined. Finally, the anthropologists attempted to engage the ladies and probe deeper cultural themes,

“What do you think about death?” 
 
Dawn was not so keen on the idea. Naheed, likewise, didn’t fancy dying just yet.
