“If you critique art, you are an art critic,” said the careers advisor to the gorgeous fleece. The warm philistine inside that fleece was me.

“You’re spot on,” I agreed. “I’ll cut my teeth at Nottingham contemporary, and I’ll have a future in this business.

The edifice itself is a crinkle-cut, concrete crumple sunk into in sandstone cliffs. A green and gold squat in a giant’s footwell. The outside appears compressed, but visitors will be impressed as the building breathes inwards to become cavernous inside. Its windows are wide. They invite me to regret arriving by tram when I notice indoor parking space for super cargo planes.

Georgian town houses across the cobbles remember when art lovers purred at portraits or lathered up to landscapes. But there’ll be none of that here. None of that now. This is a contemporary institution, a bastion of bewilderment. Its mission is to inspire almost unanswerable questions: Why did we have to come here? Can we go to KFC now? etc.

‘Our Silver City’ is the most recent vehicle to vex visitors. It arrives from a future world emerging from hellfire, crisis, and collapse. The year is 2094. Survivors with their plates full already oblige kindly to beam an exhibition back through time. It’s an open day for the future which I attend in the present.
