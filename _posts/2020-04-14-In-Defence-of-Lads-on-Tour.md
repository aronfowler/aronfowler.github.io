I do not advocate lads-on-tour and other such holidays, nor do I find them attractive; I am not disposed to enjoy burning by the pool, eating full English breakfast in swimming trunks and swaggering down the strip dispensing banter and drinking extraordinary mixes of alcohol from buckets and fishbowls. Nevertheless, I am here moved to come out in defence against charges that these forms of tourism are without meaningful content and inferior to experiences of ‘culture’ — a middle class ideal — ostensibly on offer at hotspot attractions in Athens, Rome or London, for example.

It will be my contention that such spaces of cultural attraction do not present themselves for what they are, but rather take form as spectacle and imaginary. They are empty of the proclaimed enriching cultural content that will ‘expand horizons’ because these spaces are uninhabited. On the other hand, the holiday destinations of lads-on-tour etc. are honest spaces of embodied and living activity.
