I do not advocate lads-on-tour and other such holidays, nor do I find them attractive; I am not disposed to enjoy burning by the pool, eating full English breakfast in swimming trunks and swaggering down the strip dispensing banter and drinking extraordinary mixes of alcohol from buckets and fishbowls. Nevertheless, I am here moved to come out in defence against charges that these forms of tourism are without meaningful content and inferior to experiences of ‘culture’ — a middle class ideal — ostensibly on offer at hotspot attractions in Athens, Rome or London, for example.

It will be my contention that such spaces of cultural attraction do not present themselves for what they are, but rather take form as spectacle and imaginary. They are empty of the proclaimed enriching cultural content that will ‘expand horizons’ because these spaces are uninhabited. On the other hand, the holiday destinations of lads-on-tour etc. are honest spaces of embodied and living activity.

For the purpose of this essay, ‘cultural tourism’ is the visiting of sites designated, organised and presented as deep and unique (even authentic) to the specific place — monuments, buildings, historical ruins, even streetscapes etc. These spaces have become not only _of_ tourism but _for_ tourism, and visiting is an end in itself — these places are not visited in order to realise further activity, unless perhaps the person works there. Such locations are primarily opted for on the promise of an experience of culture, learning and ‘expanded horizons’ — the archetype of this discourse is found in aeroplane magazines and from those who might list ‘travelling’ amongst their hobbies and interests. I must go on to say, however, that this promise is scarcely fulfilled, except by simulation and illusion.

It is known from the likes of Henri Lefebvre and Doreen Massey that a space, and the culture thereof, is constituted by and consequential to social relations; it exists only as a contingent product of interrelation and human activity; it is unfolding and ongoing, fluid and alive. This (true) account of space is in contrast to (misguided) conceptions which render it fixed, inert and objective. It is, upon inspection, that spaces of cultural tourism transpire to be just that — objectified, fixed and inert:

Holidays are typically short stays, and so place and culture are reduced and abstracted to _things in themselves_ or objects in space, conveniently packaged and presented for easy and, crucially, quick consumption. Place and culture are as such reified, objectified commodity whereby the inherent social relations are obscured and mystified.<sup>1
